Democracy is a political system where the power to govern is derived from the consent of the governed. In a democratic society, individuals participate in decision-making either directly or through elected representatives. Key principles include political equality, majority rule with respect for minority rights, and individual freedoms such as freedom of speech and assembly. Democracy promotes accountability, transparency, and the peaceful transfer of power through free and fair elections. It seeks to balance competing interests and foster civic engagement, ensuring that government policies reflect the will of the people while protecting fundamental rights and liberties.
