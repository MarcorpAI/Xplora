World War II was initiated by Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. This aggressive act, orchestrated by Adolf Hitler's regime, violated international agreements and triggered a chain of events leading to the global conflict. Germany's expansionist ambitions, fueled by Nazi ideology and militarization, sought to establish dominance in Europe and beyond.

Hitler's aggressive foreign policy, characterized by territorial conquests and disregard for diplomatic norms, escalated tensions across the continent. The invasion of Poland prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the official beginning of World War II.

While various factors contributed to the outbreak of war, including unresolved issues from World War I and the failure of diplomatic efforts to prevent conflict, Germany's actions under Hitler's leadership were the primary catalyst for the devastating conflict that engulfed the world.
